1) Write a query that lists each order number followed by the name of the customer who made the order.
-> select orders.onum , customers.cname
    from orders
    join customers on orders.cnum = customers.cnum;

2) Write a query that gives the names of both the salesperson and the customer for each order along with the order number.
-> select orders.onum, customers.cname, salespeople.sname
    from orders 
    join customers on orders.cnum = customers.cnum 
    join salespeople on orders.snum = salespeople.num;
3) Write a query that produces all customers serviced by salespeople with a commission above 12%. 
   Output the customer’s name, the salesperson’s name, and the salesperson’s rate of commission.
-> select c.cname, s.sname,s.comm 
    from customers c, salespeople s 
    where c.snum=s.snum having comm>0.12; 
4) Write a query that calculates the amount of the salesperson’s commission on each 
   order by a customer with a rating above 100
-> SELECT orders.Onum, customers.Cname, salespeople.Sname, (orders.Amt * salespeople.Comm) AS commission
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.Cnum = customers.Cnum
JOIN salespeople ON orders.Snum = salespeople.Snum
WHERE customers.Rating > 100;
