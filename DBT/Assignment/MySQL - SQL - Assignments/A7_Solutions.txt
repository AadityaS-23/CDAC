Summarizing Data with Aggregate Functions.
1) Write a query that counts all orders for October 3.
-> select count(*) as total_orders
    from orders
    where  odate = '1990-10-03';

2) Write a query that counts the number of different non-NULL city values in the 
Customers table.
-> select count(distinct city) as unique_cities
    from customers
    where city is not null;

3) Write a query that selects each customerâ€™s smallest order.
-> select cnum,
    min(amt) as smallest_order
    from orders
    group by cnum;
    

4) Write a query that selects the first customer, in alphabetical order, whose name 
begins with G.
-> select cname
    from customers
    where cname like 'G%'
    order by cname
    limit 1;

5) Write a query that selects the highest rating in each city.
-> select city,
    max(rating) as highest_rating
    from customers
    group by city;

6) Write a query that counts the number of salespeople registering orders for each 
day. (If a salesperson has more than one order on a given day, he or she should be 
counted only once.)
->select odate, count(distinct snum) as salespeople_count
   from orders
   group by  odate;
