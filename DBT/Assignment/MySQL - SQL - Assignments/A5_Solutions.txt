### Relational and Logical Operators. ###
 
1) Write a query that will give you all orders for more than Rs. 1,000. 
-> select * 
    from orders 
    where amt>1000;

2) Write a query that will give you the names and cities of all salespeople in 
London with a commission above .10. 
-> select sname,city
    from salespeople
    where city = 'London' and comm > 0.10;
    
3) Write a query on the Customers table whose output will exclude all customers 
with a rating <= 100, unless they are located in Rome.
-> select *
    from customers
    where rating > 100 or city = 'Rome';
 
4) What will be the output from the following query? 
 
 Select * from Orders 
 where (amt < 1000 OR 
 NOT (odate = ‘1990-10-03’ 
 AND cnum > 2003)); 
->
  //Error : 
     ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
     check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version 
     for the right syntax to use near '?1990-10-03? AND cnum > 2003))' at line 3
  //Reason : 
    Due to use of incorrect quotation marks around date value in the Query.
    Single quotes ('  ') should be used for Strings but here different quotes are used.

5) What will be the output of the following query? 
 
 Select * from Orders 
 where NOT ((odate = ‘1990-10-03’ OR snum 
 >1006) AND amt >= 1500); 
-> 
  // Error : 
     ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
    check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version
    for the right syntax to use near '?1990-10-03? OR snum >1006) AND amt >= 1500)' at line 2
 //Reason :
   Due to use of incorrect quotation marks around date value in the Query.
    Single quotes ('  ') should be used for Strings but here different quotes are used.
   
 
6) What is a simpler way to write this query? 
 
 Select snum, sname, city, comm From Salespeople 
where (comm > .12 OR comm <.14);

->  Solution 1 :
     Select snum, sname, city, comm 
     From Salespeople 
     where (comm > .12 AND comm <.14);

     Solution 2 : 
     Select snum,sname,city,comm
     from salespeople
     where comm BETWEEN 0.12 AND 0.14;
