//Joining a Table to Itself.

1) Write a query that produces all pairs of salespeople who are living in the same 
city. Exclude combinations of salespeople with themselves as well as duplicate 
rows with the order reversed.
-> Approach 1 : (w/o using joins)
    select distinct a.sname,b.sname 
    from salespeople a , salespeople b
    where a.sname > b.sname and a.city = b.city;

   Approach 2 : 
   select s1.sname as salesperson1, s2.sname as salesperson2, s1.City
   from salespeople s1
   join salespeople s2 ON s1.City = s2.City 
   where s1.Snum < s2.Snum;



2) Write a query that produces the names and cities of all customers with the same 
rating as Hoffman
-> Approach 1 :
    


    Approach 2: 
    select cname, City
    from  customers
    where rating = (select rating from customers where cname = 'Hoffman');
