Using Subqueries with DML Commands.
1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. 
   Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.
-> create table Multicust as select * from salespeople
    where snum in (select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1);

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
-> delete from  customers 
    where cnum not in (select cnum from orders );
 
3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000
-> update salespeople 
    set comm = comm + 0.20 
    where snum = 
    any(select snum from orders where amt>3000 );
