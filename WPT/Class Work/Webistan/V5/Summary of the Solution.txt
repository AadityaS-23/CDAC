Summary of the Solution
1.Backend Setup:

>>A Node.js server is created using Express.js and connected to a MySQL database.
>>An API endpoint (/api/orders) is established to handle POST requests for creating new bookings.
>>The server listens on port 3000, and upon receiving data, it inserts the booking into the orders
   table in the MySQL database.

2.Frontend Implementation:

>>The booking.js file is modified to send form data to the backend API when the booking form is 
   submitted.
>>The form submission is prevented from reloading the page, and the booking data is sent as a JSON 
   object to the backend.
>>Upon successful booking, the new booking is added to a local array and displayed on the page.
>>Users are notified of success or failure, and the form is reset after submission.

3.Testing:

>>The implementation is tested by opening the booking.html page, filling out the form, and checking 
   the MySQL database for new entries.
>>The bookings are displayed on the page, providing a clear view of all booked services.


## Differences Between the Two Implementations ##

1.Data Handling:

>>New Implementation: Sends the booking data to the backend API and stores it in a MySQL 
   database.
>>Previous Implementation: Stores the booking data only in a local array and saves the last booking in 
   localStorage.

2.Form Submission:

>>New Implementation: Uses fetch to send a POST request to the backend upon form submission.
>>Previous Implementation: Directly adds the booking to the local array and opens a new confirmation 
   page without sending data to a server.

3.Display Logic:

>>New Implementation: Displays bookings that are fetched from the backend after a successful 
   submission.
>>Previous Implementation: Displays bookings from the local array without any server interaction.

4.Booking Object Structure:

>>New Implementation: Uses properties service_type, service_date, and service_time in the booking 
   object.
>>Previous Implementation: Uses properties serviceType, date, and time, which differ in naming 
   conventions.

5.Edit and Delete Functionality:

>>New Implementation: Intended to have a delete function that interacts with the backend to remove 
   bookings from the database (though the delete route isn't shown in the provided backend code).
>>Previous Implementation: Deletes bookings only from the local array without any backend interaction.


6.User Notifications:

>>New Implementation: Notifies users of success or failure based on the API response.

>>Previous Implementation: Opens a new page upon booking without notifying the user of any success or 
   failure.

## Conclusion :


The new implementation is designed for a more robust application that interacts with a backend 
database, allowing for persistent storage of bookings, while the previous implementation is more simplistic and only manages data in the browser's memory.

The solution you provided utilizes a combination of technologies for both the backend and frontend components. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the technologies used:

## Backend Technologies ##
1.Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It 
  is used to build the server application.

2.Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web 
  applications and APIs. It is used to handle HTTP requests and responses.

3.MySQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store the booking data in a 
  structured format. In this case, it is used to create and manage the HomeServices database and  
  the orders table.

4.CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): A middleware that allows your server to handle requests  
   from different origins, enabling your frontend application to communicate with the backend.

5.Body-Parser: A middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your 
   handlers, making it easier to access data sent in JSON format.

## Frontend Technologies ##
1.HTML: The markup language used to structure the content of the booking page (booking.html).

2.JavaScript: A programming language used to create dynamic and interactive content on the web. It 
   is used in the booking.js file to handle form submissions, manage bookings, and interact with the  
   backend API.

3.CSS (Bootstrap): Although not explicitly mentioned in your provided code, the use of Bootstrap 
  classes in the JavaScript code (list-group-item, btn, etc.) suggests that Bootstrap is used for 
  styling the frontend and making it responsive.

Summary
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, CORS, Body-Parser
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, CSS (Bootstrap)
These technologies work together to create a full-stack application that allows users to book services, with data being stored persistently in a MySQL database and dynamically displayed on a web page.
